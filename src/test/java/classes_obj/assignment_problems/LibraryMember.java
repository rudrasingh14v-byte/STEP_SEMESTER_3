     * Explanation of why static is wrong here:
     * - name: A member's name is unique to the individual. Making it static means all members share one name,
     *   so creating a new member overwrites everyone else's name.
     * - memberId: Like name, the ID must be unique per member. Static makes it shared.
     * - booksIssued: Each member tracks their own borrowed books. Static would track one global total
     *   instead of per-member totals.
